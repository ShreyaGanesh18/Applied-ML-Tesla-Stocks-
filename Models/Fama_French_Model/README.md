# Tesla
# Linear Regression Project:- Testing various Models (Fama-French)

## Overview
The Fama and French Three-Factor Model is an asset pricing model developed in 1992 that expands on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) by adding size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factor in CAPM. In this project we have attempted to implement the Fama-French Model on Tesla's Return price for the year of 2019.
